# Bitcoin theory of diminishing returns using Data Science
## Overview
Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency created by a pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin is known as a type of cryptocurrency because it uses cryptography to keep it secure. Since its creation in January 2009, its has gained much popularity and even reached a market cap of over a trillion dollars.

With such phenomenal historical returns, many retail investors are flocking to the asset in search of quick riches. The purpose of this project is show that while the asset class may still be trending up over time, one might want to think twice if they are investing in the dream of making another 100x on their investments from here on.

## The Law of Diminishing Returns
The law of diminishing marginal returns is a theory in economics that states that after some optimal level of capacity is reached, increasing a factor of production will actually result in smaller increases in output.

The aim of this project is to prove that while Bitcoin is know for phenomenal returns, diminishing returns applies as well. We will be proving diminishing returns by calculating the deviation from its fair value. We will be estimating the fair value of bitcoin in two ways:

1. Using the 20 week Simple Moving Average and 21 week Exponential Moving Average
2. Using Logarithmic Regression

We will be using Bitcoin Historical data from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data
